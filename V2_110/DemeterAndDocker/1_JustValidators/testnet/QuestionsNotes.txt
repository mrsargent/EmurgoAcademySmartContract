Creating a contract
1. Create the script in haskell or equivalent
2. serialize the script and write to .plutus file 
3. run a command such as "cardano-cli address build --payment-script-file AlwaysSucceedScript.plutus --testnet-magic 2 --out-file AlwaysSucceedScript.addr"
    to derive the address from the serialized script 


Locking value and data on a smart contract
1. you are sending a contract address value in ADA from an address
2. you are also sending that address a datum
3. the address will contain a utxo that will contain the hash of the datum 
4. the only signature needed is the one of the collateral


Unlocking value and data from a smart contract
1. for the -tx-in you are going to use the a uxto from the smart contract address
2. you are sending a value specified in the output from the contract to address
2a. you are using the actual plutus file that contains the cbor hex of the smart contract 
3. you are sending a datum and redeemer to that contract to validate the logic in the contract. 
4. the only signature needed is the one of the collateral 


Questions??
when unlocking a transaction can you output value to multiple addresses?
it seems strange to me that when I unlock to uxtos both containing a value of 5A that the output only sends 3A to the destination address
and the rest (6.28A) is sent as change????


yesterday in your example where did the alwaysfailt script come in to play.  I thought we were using dER script?


the inline datum seems more usable.  Because let's say someone submitted a smart contract online.  Then someone else tried to unlock the value.  They would have to know the datums hash in order
to unlock??? With inline datums they wouldn't have to know this?

The point to remember is that in Cardano the smartcontract INCLUDES the tx definition, so tx interval vs validator interval is the condition to check
